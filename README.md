# I_LOVE_YOU-Virus
I love you virus file (Note: free to use it will shutdown his/her computer but if it harms his/her system am not responsible)

KEY TO SUCCESS :
        On the machine system level, ILOVEYOU relied on the scripting engine system setting (which runs scripting language files such as .vbs files) being enabled, and took advantage of a feature in Windows that hid file extensions by default, which malware authors would use as an exploit. Windows would parse file names from right to left, stopping at the first period character, showing only those elements to the left of this. The attachment, which had two periods, could thus display the inner fake "txt" file extension. True text files are considered to be innocuous, as they are incapable of running executable code. The worm used social engineering to entice users to open the attachment (out of actual desire to connect or simple curiosity) to ensure continued propagation. Systemic weaknesses in the design of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Windows were exploited that allowed malicious code capable of complete access to the operating system, secondary storage, and system and user data simply by unwitting users clicking on an icon. 

SPREAD :
        Messages generated in the Philippines began to spread westwards through corporate email systems. Because the worm used mailing lists as its source of targets, the messages often appeared to come from acquaintances and were therefore often regarded as "safe" by their victims, providing further incentive to open them. Only a few users at each site had to access the attachment to generate millions more messages that crippled mail systems and overwrote millions of files on computers in each successive network.
     
 IMPACT :

        The worm originated in the Pandacan neighborhood of Manila in the Philippines on May 5, 2000, thereafter following daybreak westward across the world as employees began their workday that Friday morning, moving first to Hong Kong, then to Europe, and finally the United States. The outbreak was later estimated to have caused US$5.5â€“8.7 billion in damages worldwide,[better source needed] and estimated to cost US$15 billion to remove the worm.[7] Within ten days, over fifty million infections had been reported,[8] and it is estimated that 10% of internet-connected computers in the world had been affected.[6][better source needed] Damage cited was mostly the time and effort spent getting rid of the infection and recovering files from backups. To protect themselves, The Pentagon, CIA, the British Parliament and most large corporations decided to completely shut down their mail systems.[9] The ILOVEYOU worm infected computers all over the world. At the time it was one of the world's most destructive computer related disasters ever.

        The events inspired the song "E-mail" on the Pet Shop Boys' UK top-ten album of 2002, Release, the lyrics of which play thematically on the human desires which enabled the mass destruction of this computer infection.

Template documentation

Initial visibility: currently defaults to autocollapse

To set this template's initial visibility, the |state= parameter may be used:

    |state=collapsed: {{Hacking in the 2010s|state=collapsed}} to show the template collapsed, i.e., hidden apart from its title bar
    |state=expanded: {{Hacking in the 2010s|state=expanded}} to show the template expanded, i.e., fully visible
    |state=autocollapse: {{Hacking in the 2010s|state=autocollapse}}
        shows the template collapsed to the title bar if there is a {{navbar}}, a {{sidebar}}, or some other table on the page with the collapsible attribute
        shows the template in its expanded state if there are no other collapsible items on the page

If the |state= parameter in the template on this page is not set, the template's initial visibility is taken from the |default= parameter in the Collapsible option template. For the template on this page, that currently evaluates to autocollapse.
